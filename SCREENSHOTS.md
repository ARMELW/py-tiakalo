![Karafun Karaoke in Action](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6fbebec-44c4-4894-ae1f-7eefdfeec2f4)

**What you see in this screenshot:**

1. **Header (Top)**
   - Site branding: "tiakalo.org" on the left
   - Status indicator: "♪ KARAOKE" on the right
   - Magenta accent line at the very top

2. **Two-Line Display (Center)**
   - **Upper line**: "Two lines display**ed** at the same time"
     - Words "Two lines display" are in **magenta** (already sung)
     - Word "ed" is **white** (current word being sung)
     - Words "at the same time" are **white** (upcoming)
   
   - **Lower line**: "Watch words turn from white to pink"
     - All words are **white** (next line, not yet sung)

3. **Background**
   - Dark blue color (RGB: 10, 10, 30)
   - Professional, non-distracting

## Key Features Visible

✅ **Two-line display** - Both current and next line are shown
✅ **Color progression** - Sung words turn magenta, unsung stay white
✅ **Professional header** - Clean branding at the top
✅ **Centered layout** - All text perfectly centered
✅ **Bold typography** - Easy-to-read bold fonts

## How It Works

As the karaoke plays:
1. Words start **white** (unsung)
2. The current word fills progressively with **magenta** as you sing
3. Once sung, words remain **magenta** 
4. The next line fades in below so you're always prepared

This creates the authentic karaoke experience where you can see what's coming while focusing on what you're singing now.
